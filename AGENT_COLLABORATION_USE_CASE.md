# ü§ñ Agent Collaboration Use Case: Supply Chain Optimization

## üéØ **Scenario: "Optimize our supply chain for the next quarter"**

Let me show you a **real-world example** of how specialized agents collaborate to solve complex supply chain problems.

## üìã **The Request**
```
User: "I need to optimize our supply chain for the next quarter. 
       We're seeing some stockouts and want to prevent them while 
       keeping costs down. Can you analyze everything and give me 
       a comprehensive plan?"
```

## üîÑ **Agent Collaboration Flow**

### **Step 1: üß† Orchestrator Agent (Entry Point)**
```python
# Orchestrator receives the request
orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator()
intent = orchestrator._analyze_intent(user_input)

# Intent Analysis Results:
{
    "primary_agent": "orchestrator",
    "complex_request": True,
    "needs_forecasting": True,
    "needs_supplier_recommendations": True,
    "needs_logistics_optimization": True
}
```

### **Step 2: üìà Forecasting Agent (Demand Prediction)**
```python
# Forecasting Agent gets historical data
forecasting_agent = ForecastingAgent()
historical_data = [
    {"id": "PROD-001", "name": "Product A", "historical_demand": [100, 120, 110, 130, 115, 125]},
    {"id": "PROD-002", "name": "Product B", "historical_demand": [50, 55, 60, 45, 50, 55]},
    {"id": "PROD-003", "name": "Product C", "historical_demand": [200, 180, 220, 190, 210, 200]}
]

# Generate demand forecasts
forecasts = forecasting_agent.forecast_demand(historical_data, forecast_periods=90)

# Results:
{
    "demand_forecasts": {
        "PROD-001": {
            "ensemble_forecast": [128, 130, 132, 134, 136],  # Next 5 periods
            "confidence": "high",
            "trend": "increasing",
            "seasonality": "moderate"
        },
        "PROD-002": {
            "ensemble_forecast": [58, 59, 60, 61, 62],
            "confidence": "medium", 
            "trend": "stable",
            "seasonality": "weak"
        }
    }
}
```

### **Step 3: üßÆ Inventory Agent (Stock Analysis)**
```python
# Inventory Agent analyzes current stock
inventory_agent = InventoryAgent()
inventory_data = [
    {"id": "PROD-001", "name": "Product A", "current_stock": 150, "min_stock": 50, "reorder_point": 75},
    {"id": "PROD-002", "name": "Product B", "current_stock": 25, "min_stock": 30, "reorder_point": 40},
    {"id": "PROD-003", "name": "Product C", "current_stock": 0, "min_stock": 20, "reorder_point": 25}
]

# Analyze stock levels
stock_analysis = inventory_agent.analyze_stock_levels(inventory_data)

# Results:
{
    "low_stock_items": [
        {"item_id": "PROD-002", "name": "Product B", "current_stock": 25, "reorder_point": 40, "urgency": "high"}
    ],
    "out_of_stock_items": [
        {"item_id": "PROD-003", "name": "Product C", "impact": "critical"}
    ],
    "overstocked_items": []
}

# Calculate reorder points with forecast data
reorder_analysis = inventory_agent.calculate_reorder_points(inventory_data, forecasts)

# Results:
{
    "reorder_recommendations": [
        {
            "item_id": "PROD-001", 
            "recommended_reorder_point": 85,  # Up from 75
            "safety_stock": 15,
            "confidence": "high"
        },
        {
            "item_id": "PROD-002",
            "recommended_reorder_point": 45,  # Up from 40  
            "safety_stock": 8,
            "confidence": "medium"
        }
    ]
}
```

### **Step 4: üè≠ Supplier Agent (Procurement Optimization)**
```python
# Supplier Agent gets low stock items and supplier data
supplier_agent = SupplierAgent()
supplier_data = [
    {
        "id": "SUP-001", "name": "TechCorp Solutions", "reliability_score": 95,
        "delivery_time": 7, "unit_cost": 25.99, "products": "Product A; Product B"
    },
    {
        "id": "SUP-002", "name": "Global Parts Inc", "reliability_score": 78,
        "delivery_time": 14, "unit_cost": 15.50, "products": "Product B; Product C"
    }
]

# Analyze supplier performance
performance_analysis = supplier_agent.analyze_supplier_performance(supplier_data)

# Results:
{
    "supplier_performance": {
        "SUP-001": {
            "overall_score": 0.92,
            "performance_tier": "excellent",
            "recommendations": []
        },
        "SUP-002": {
            "overall_score": 0.68,
            "performance_tier": "average", 
            "recommendations": ["Improve delivery reliability", "Reduce delivery lead times"]
        }
    }
}

# Optimize procurement for low stock items
procurement_recs = supplier_agent.optimize_procurement(supplier_data, {
    "items": [
        {"item_name": "Product B", "quantity": 200, "urgency": "high"},
        {"item_name": "Product C", "quantity": 150, "urgency": "critical"}
    ]
})

# Results:
{
    "procurement_recommendations": [
        {
            "item_name": "Product B",
            "recommended_suppliers": [
                {"supplier_name": "TechCorp Solutions", "score": 0.95, "delivery_time": 7, "cost": 5198.00},
                {"supplier_name": "Global Parts Inc", "score": 0.72, "delivery_time": 14, "cost": 3100.00}
            ],
            "recommendation": "Use TechCorp Solutions for fastest delivery"
        }
    ]
}
```

### **Step 5: üöö Logistics Agent (Shipping Optimization)**
```python
# Logistics Agent optimizes shipping routes
logistics_agent = LogisticsAgent()
shipping_data = {
    "orders": procurement_recs,
    "warehouse_locations": ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago"],
    "supplier_locations": ["San Francisco", "Seattle", "Miami"]
}

# Optimize shipping routes
shipping_optimization = logistics_agent.optimize_shipping_routes(shipping_data)

# Results:
{
    "optimized_routes": [
        {
            "route": "TechCorp Solutions ‚Üí New York Warehouse",
            "estimated_cost": 125.50,
            "estimated_time": "2 days",
            "optimization_savings": 15.75
        }
    ],
    "total_savings": 15.75
}
```

### **Step 6: üéØ Orchestrator Agent (Synthesis)**
```python
# Orchestrator synthesizes all results
comprehensive_analysis = {
    "forecast_insights": forecasts,
    "inventory_analysis": stock_analysis,
    "reorder_optimization": reorder_analysis,
    "supplier_performance": performance_analysis,
    "procurement_recommendations": procurement_recs,
    "shipping_optimization": shipping_optimization
}

# Generate comprehensive recommendations
recommendations = [
    "üö® URGENT: Product C is out of stock - place emergency order with Global Parts Inc",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Product B is low on stock - reorder 200 units from TechCorp Solutions (7-day delivery)",
    "üìà Update reorder points: Product A (85), Product B (45) based on demand forecasts",
    "üè≠ Consider diversifying suppliers for Product C to reduce risk",
    "üí∞ Potential shipping savings: $15.75 through route optimization"
]
```
